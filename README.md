- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort

### To run the program
```sh
make -f file.mk
./a.out
```

## Output Format

The program generates 2 csv files which are used to generate graphs. 
- One for Array-Size vs Time taken
- One for Array-Size vs No. of Comparison

The program also generates 2 files for every sorting algorithm
- One for Array-Size vs Time
- One for Array-Sizr vs No. of Comparisons
